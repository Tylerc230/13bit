I am a San Francisco based, iOS consultant offering a wide range of services and solutions. I’ve been an engineer in the mobile space since 2005 with a proven track record of completing projects on time and exceeding client expectations. At <strong>Zynga</strong>, I was responsible for bringing several high profile games to market, including Farmville for iOS and Cityville for iOS. Since becoming a fulltime consultant, I’ve shipped many utility and lifestyle applications for clients such as <strong>Fitbit</strong>, <strong>Calm.com</strong> and <strong>BestBuy</strong>. I'm particularly interested in BLE/IoT based applications and photo and video editing apps. I enjoy working closely with designers to build products that stand out. I'm available to work on site in San Francisco or remote. I’m always excited to learn new things and expand my skillset. If you have an idea and would like to collaborate, feel free to <a href="mailto:tyler@13bit.io">contact me</a>.<br>
