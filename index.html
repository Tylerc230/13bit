              <p>I am a San Francisco based, freelance iOS application developer offering a wide range of services and solutions. I’ve been a software engineer in the mobile space since 2005 with a proven track record of completing projects on time and exceeding client expectations. At Zynga, I was responsible for bringing several high profile games, including Farmville for iOS and Cityville for iOS, to market. In recent years I’ve shipped multiple utility and lifestyle applications as well. I’m interested in opportunities which provide new challenges and allow me to expand my skill set.<br>
              I am currently only looking for contract work. If you have an idea and would like to collaborate, feel free to contact me.<br>
              <em>Note: Please be aware of fraudulent developers on websites like Upwork/Odesk/Elance using my name and likeness to attract clients. I do not use those websites to find work.</em>
