Zinc is an all mode communication platform for the deskless worker. It combines chat, video calling, push to talk an more. While at Zinc, I rewrote the messaging timeline to resemble Facebook Messenger's timeline with grouped chat bubbles, inline media and read/typing indicators. I also created the main radial menu. I implemented several integrations with the system including CallKit, deep linking, and much more. This app relied heavily on CoreData and AFNetworking and also utilized RxSwift, PushKit and Twillio for voice calling.
