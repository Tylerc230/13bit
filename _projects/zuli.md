The companion app to the [Zuli Smartplug](https://zuli.io/), a **Bluetooth LE** enabled Smartplug allowing users to interact with lights and other appliances from their phone. The core of the application is a command based protocol built on top of BLE allowing commands to propagate throughout the Smartplug home network even when a plug is not within range of the phone. The app implements various functionality via machine learning and OpenCV. Custom crafted UI with intricately choreographed animation can be seen throughout the app.
