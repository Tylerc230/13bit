## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/headshot.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

My passion for tinkering started one evening when I stumbled upon Flash and ActionScript. The hours flew by and as the sun came up, I knew what I wanted to do with my life. That passion for building things has stayed with me almost 20 years later. Spending hours immersed in a project is still one of the greatest joys I know.

Long before the iPhone, I decided to work in the mobile space because of the immense potential it held. Today, the influence connected devices have on people's lives is clear, but we've still only scratched the surface of what is possible. BLE and connected homes offer almost unlimited opportunities to control our environment while faster processors and on device machine learning are making phones smarter and more intuitive than ever.

I consider myself to be a jack of all trades. I've spent time writing firmware and designing PCBs for personal projects. I've done substantial server side development in Python and Ruby, spent time writing OpenGL shaders and climbed the functional ladder. I consider TDD to be a essential tool in the fight against technical debt. Every new skill mastered is a potential solution to problem.

Cooking and riding bikes is the best way I know to balance a long day spent in front of the computer. Lately I've been recording my thoughts on programming and technology in my [blog](https://www.sfsoftwareist.com). 
If there is a project you'd like help on or just want to grab a cup of coffee and chat about technology, feel free to [contact me](mailto:tyler@13bit.io).
