## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/headshot.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
For the past 16 years, I have been an avid software developer, with 11 years experience in the mobile space.  I chose mobile because of the influence it has on people’s lives and how they interact with the world. I have a passion for creating fun, beautiful products; helping turn ideas into applications that people enjoy.
My current interests are server side Python, AWS, TDD and functional/reactive programming in Swift. I am a command line junky and love writing scripts to make my life easier and more productive. In the past I’ve worked on everything from web applications to microcontrollers and embedded technologies. The tools I use on a regular basis are git, vim, Xcode, RubyMine, and a Macbook Pro. When I’m not coding I’m riding road bikes, cooking or working on my blog.
